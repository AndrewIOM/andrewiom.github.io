# Population Projections for the Isle of Man (2021 to 2051) and their application to the Area Plan for the North and West

**Note: This document is currently being updated. The full method and data for the population projection will be available shortly.**

The Isle of Man Strategic Plan is the Isle of Man's overarching planning policy framework. The document has a lifetime of 2011 to 2026.

## The cost of housing is not the key factor stopping young people from returning to the Island

Since at least 1976, the Isle of Man has had a consistent age structure in its migration pattern. There has always been the lowest rate of net migration in the 19 to 24 age group, which reflects young people leaving the island for university and training in the UK and further afield.

The trends suggest that if graduates return, this is usually in their late 20s or early 30s.

However, many Manx-educated graduates do not return, and the reasons for this have been previously identified. A substantial graduate survey undertaken by Government for the 2017 '*Meeting Our Population Challenges*' report indicated that the cost of housing is not the primary driver that keeps graduates from returning to the Island. The most common reason that graduates do not return is that there are better career prospects elsewhere.

The comparable cost of housing only cited by 22% of graduates, compared to nearly 80% citing differences in career prospects. Similarly, when asked about incentives to return to the island, improvements to career options are overwhelmingly favoured compared to 'affordable housing'.

The lack of interest in financial incentives indicates that graduates' failure to return is inelastic to monetary drivers and conditioned purely on the selection of economic sectors currently present on the island. The evidence suggests therefore that gambling and other dominant sectors as currently structured are not attractive to graduates.

## Enough housing has already been constructed to meet the community's needs to 2026

Despite thousands of housing units being constructed between 2011 and 2021, the size of the population was identical to 2011 levels by 2021.

In the Area Plan for the North and West, Cabinet Office have proposed to allocate enough land as residential to provide up to 1,784 developable housing units. Cabinet Office suggest that the estimated yield for these sites will be 965, once the probability of development, land use for community facilities and infrastructure, and 'net biodiversity gain' are taken into account.

### a) Low estimates of housing yield (per hectare) are likely masking far higher final housing numbers than presented

In this area plan Cabinet Office have changed the methods they use to calculate the 'developable area' of greenfield sites and their estimated yield when comapred to the recent Area Plan for the East (TAPE - which was prepared under Howard Quayle's administration). If the 'developable area' as stated in the Area Plan for the North and West is applied to the yield calculations from the Area Plan for the East, **the yield is estimated as 1,792**. If the gross area of land proposed is assessed against the full methods from the Area Plan for the East, **the proposed yield is 2,260**. 

Clearly, the estimated yield of 1,792 - 2,260 is drastically different to the proposed yield of 965 (at least 85% more).

In fact, when the TAPE methods are applied the proposed land allocation is more than the Strategic Plan identified as needed for the whole 15-year period of 2011 to 2026.

### b) The population is estimated to be 85,444 by 2026, 8,082 people less than predicted

The Strategic Plan (2016) stated that enough housing opportunities must be available to provision for the housing needs of a population of 93,526 by 2026. However, population projections indicate that it is most likely that the population will be 85,444 (median prediction) by 2026.
